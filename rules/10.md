# 10: Follow up on success.

Once a new contributor has been able to carry their first contribution over the line, 
you're likely to have have a sense of their strenghts and weakensses, and this is
a good time to invite them to continue their involvement in your project.

The first and most important thing is to thank them for their contribution. Gratitude
and recognition are the most powerful tools available for community builders and
maintainers. 

After that, consider what you've learned of this contributor to help them find a the
next issue they might want to work on, if we have aspirations for our open source projects
as a welcome and empopwering community, it's important that this be an invitation, not a
suggestion or demand.
