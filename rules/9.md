# Keep your own house in order.

There is no point in inviting people to be a part of a dysfunctional or toxic community, nor is there
any point in making such a community more accessible or participatory, if your goals are to grow your
community and increase involvement in your project. Likewise, the work of creating a code of conduct
will be wasted without if the enforcement process is seen to be toothless or selective.

Whatever our intentions, our commitment to our goals and values is seen through our actions; if new
participants to our community are disciplined for the same behavior for which longtime participants 
get a pass, then you should expect any community-building efforts to fail.
