1. Reformatted authors' affiliations.
   - Please note that the link in the Word document to the example 404's.

2. I confirm that there was no funding for this work.

3. I have removed the Abstract and Author Summary.

4. I have moved the Acknowledgments to be just prior to the References.

5. We have turned the bullet list in Rule 1 into prose, but decided to leave the list in Rule 3 as-is.

6. The "figure" is text, so I have inlined it.
